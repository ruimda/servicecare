# Service Care
By: Rui Anast√°cio - April 2020

This project is a code challenge proposed by MAN. It consists of a Web application that displays truck location and nearby points of interest.

Has two components:

- A backend app written in Java Spring Boot, called truck-service. This service implements a REST API that provides information about the
 truck and it's last locations. More info here: [Truck-Service](backend/truck-service/README.md)

- A frontend app (monitor) written in React, that displays the truck location on the Map, and let's users find nearby points of interest. 
More info here: [Monitor](frontend/monitor/README.md)

## Screenshots

Some screenshots explained:
